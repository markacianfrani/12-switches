> A psychologist friend at Bell Telephone Laboratories once built a machine with about 12 switches and a red and a green light. You set the switches, pushed a button, and either you got a red or a green light. After the first person tried it twenty times they wrote a theory of how to make the green light come on. The theory was given to the next victim and they had their twenty tries and wrote their theory, and so on endlessly. The stated purpose of the test was to study how theories evolved.

> But my friend, being the kind of person he was, had connected the lights to a random source! One day he observed to me that no person in all the tests (and they were all high class Bell Telephone Laboratories scientists) ever said there was no message. I promptly observed to him not one of them was either a statistician or an information theorist, the two classes of people who are intimately familiar with randomness. A check revealed I was right!

>This is a sad commentary on your education. You are lovingly taught how one theory was displaced by another, but you are seldom taught to replace a nice theory with nothing but randomness! And this is what was needed; the ability to say the theory you just read is no good and there was no definite pattern in the data, only randomness.
